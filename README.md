This repository demonstrates a common but easily overlooked issue in Dockerfiles: using `ubuntu:latest` and a vulnerable `COPY` command.  The original `Dockerfile` is insecure and its build process is not reliable. The `Dockerfile-fixed` provides a much improved version by specifying a particular Ubuntu version and using a safer build process.  Always use a specific image tag and avoid unnecessary use of `COPY` to ensure your Docker images are secure and consistent.
